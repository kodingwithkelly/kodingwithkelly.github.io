                                    As shown on the choropleth graphs created, specifically the gini coefficient one, there are <b>great inequalities 
                                    of income in Alameda, Berkeley, and Oakland</b>. The inequality can also be seen in the median household income graphs 
                                    because in the areas where there is inequality, there shows low median income. This further proves that there are both 
                                    low and high incomes in those areas.  For the most part, CA 502 is balanced in the sense that the two choropleth maps 
                                    of median gross rent and household income look similar. However, there are areas within Alameda county in the middle 
                                    upper part of CA 502, as well as parts of Union City and Fremont that exhibit a <b>disparity in median gross rent and median 
                                    household income</b>. This essentially means that the <b>rent exceeds the salary they make which could cause homelessness</b>. In 
                                    terms of homeowning as housing tenure, the median value of owner-occupied housing map shows that areas that earn more 
                                    income have the highest home prices. This proportion holds constant for low income areas, too, with the exception of 
                                    Oakland and Berkeley where the prices of houses are more than the median income. Based on our findings with the maps, 
                                    we can conclude that most likely the area with the most homelessness in CA 502 is around Alameda, Berkeley, and Oakland. <br><br>
	                                Now according to the PIT table, CA 502 had <b>8,022 people</b> identifying as homeless in 2019. This was broken down to be <b>47% Blacks</b>, 
                                    <b>31% Whites</b>, <b>17% Hispanics/Latinos</b>, <b>4% Native American/Alaskan Native</b>, and <b>2% Asians and Hawaiians</b>. This is a <b>large increase
                                    from 2018 which had 5,496 people identifying as homeless</b>. The percentages of race/ethnic groups that were homeless from 2018 
                                    were around the same as well and have remained somewhat the same throughout the years. On the other hand, CA 502 has only offered 
                                    an average of 1,723 beds with the majority going towards emergency shelters. <b>Despite the growing number of homelessness, 
                                    the amount of beds has not increased</b>. Rather, in 2016 where there were only 4,145 people who identified as homeless, there 
                                    were 1,803 beds and in 2019 there were only 1,757 beds for 8,022 people. <br><br>
									Results show a <b>46% increase in homelessness</b> and <b>49.64% reduction of shelter resources.</b>
